# Genre Based Sentimental Analysis of Movies using NLP
William Shakespeare said “What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” Indeed the name of a movie means a lot more than it seems. This paper proposes a new insight in the naming convention of movies. I propose and derive with the help of NLP tools that a movie is widely accepted by the audience when the name of the movie sounds positive. Also, the rating of a movie could depend on the genre. Action, romance, fantasy and comedy movies are on the hit list of the audience and critics too rate them well. Most people in general tend to stay away from horror and crime. Drama and sci-fi movies are on the hit-list of critics pulling the scores down.
